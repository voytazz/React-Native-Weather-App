This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

It's my first project in React Native. App (not rendered to apk yet) show simple weather information.
If you want you can use EXPO.IO to live preview (after npm install in main folder).
